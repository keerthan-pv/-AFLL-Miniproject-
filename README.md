Got it! You're aiming for a **clean, professional-looking README** without any unwanted "Copy" icons or clutter ‚Äî just like the style in your first screenshot. Below is the refined markdown content that you can copy and paste directly into your `README.md` file on GitHub. It will render cleanly with proper formatting and without those unnecessary buttons/icons.

# AFLL Mini Project - Grammar & Parser for Python Constructs

This mini project was developed as part of the **Automata Formal Language and Logic (UE23CS242A)** course at **PES University**.  
It demonstrates how context-free grammars (CFGs) and lexical analysis can be used to simulate basic language constructs using Python and PLY.

## üéØ Objective

To define grammars and implement a lexer and parser that can recognize and validate various programming constructs like loops, functions, conditionals, and declarations.

---

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Library:** PLY - Python Lex-Yacc

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Install PLY:
   ```bash
   pip install ply
   ```

2. Run the parser:
   ```bash
   python afll_parser.py
   ```

---

## ‚úÖ Features

**Context-Free Grammar rules implemented for:**
- Function definitions  
- While loops  
- If-elif-else conditionals  
- Data type declarations  
- Array declarations  

**Lexical analyzer for:**
- Identifiers  
- Keywords  
- Numbers  
- Operators and delimiters  

---

## üß™ Sample Input Code

```python
for i in range(10):
    break;

if (x < y):
    something();
else:
    something_else();

def function():
    return 0;
```

---

## üì§ Output

Parses each input code and reports whether it follows the defined grammar rules.  
The output shows success messages or highlights invalid constructs.

---

## üìå Conclusion

This project showcases the practical implementation of formal grammar concepts by building a lexer and parser for a simplified programming language using Python.  
It serves as a hands-on learning tool for compiler design and language processing.
